# bhb_noise
this seperates the button and gate inputs to provide 4 ways to generate noise and gates
It offers 4 noise makers and gate generators for big honkin button module
Just feed in some melodic cv's and away you go
1. with no gate plugged in it makes a random sinewave that responds to cv and outputs a gate based on a threshold
2. with a gate signal plugged in it generate random noise voltages responding to cv input
3. with button short pressed it plays a sample modified by cv input and outputs a gate
4. with button long pressed it acts a burst generator and plays a sample according to an array of intervals
